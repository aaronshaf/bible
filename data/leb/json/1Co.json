    "1:3": "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "1:4": "I give thanks to my God always concerning you, because of the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus,",
    "1:5": "that<note: *Or \"because\"; the conjunction either (1) introduces a content clause (\"that\") giving the content of Paul's thanks, or (2) introduces a causal clause (\"because\") giving the reason for Paul's thanks> in everything you were made rich in him, in all speech and all knowledge,",
    "1:6": "just as the testimony about Christ has been confirmed in you,",
    "1:7": "so that you do not lack in any spiritual gift [as you]<note: *Here \"[as]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"eagerly await\") which is understood as temporal> eagerly await the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,",
    "1:8": "who will also confirm you until the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "1:9": "God [is] faithful, by whom you were called to fellowship with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.",
    "1:10": "Now I exhort you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all say the same [thing] and there not be divisions among you, and that you be made complete in the same mind and with the same purpose.",
    "1:11": "For it has been made clear to me concerning you, my brothers, by {Chloe's people}<note: Literally \"those of Chloe\">, that there are quarrels among you.",
    "1:12": "But I say this, that each of you is saying, \"I am with Paul,\" and \"I [am] with Apollos,\" and \"I [am] with Cephas,\" and \"I [am] with Christ.\"",
    "1:13": "Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you, was he?<note: *The negative construction in Greek anticipates a negative answer here> Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?",
    "1:14": "I give thanks<note: Some manuscripts have \"I give thanks to God\"> that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,",
    "1:15": "lest anyone should say that you were baptized in my name.",
    "1:16": "(Now I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Beyond that I do not know if I baptized anyone else.)",
    "1:17": "For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to proclaim the gospel, not with {clever speech}<note: Literally \"wisdom of word\">, lest the cross of Christ be emptied.",
    "1:18": "For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.",
    "1:19": "For it is written, \"I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the intelligence of the intelligent I will confound.\"<note: A quotation from Isa 29:14>\r\n",
    "1:20": "Where [is] the wise person? Where [is] the scribe? Where [is] the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?",
    "1:21": "For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom did not know God, God was pleased through the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe.",
    "1:22": "For indeed, Jews ask for sign miracles and Greeks seek wisdom,",
    "1:23": "but we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a cause for stumbling, but to the Gentiles foolishness,",
    "1:24": "but to those [who are] called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ [is] the power of God and the wisdom of God.",
    "1:25": "For the foolishness of God is wiser than human [wisdom],<note: Literally \"man\"> and the weakness of God [is] stronger than human [strength].<note: Literally \"man\">",
    "1:26": "For consider your calling, brothers, that not many [were] wise according to human standards,<note: Literally \"according to flesh\"> not many [were] powerful, not many [were] well born.",
    "1:27": "But the foolish [things] of the world God chose in order that he might put to shame the wise, and the weak [things] of the world God chose in order that he might put to shame the strong,",
    "1:28": "and the insignificant of the world, and the despised, God chose, the things that are not, in order that he might abolish the things that are,",
    "1:29": "so that all flesh may not boast before God.",
    "1:30": "But from him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption,",
    "1:31": "so that, just as it is written, \"The one who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.\"<note: A quotation from Jer 9:24>",
    "2:1": "And I, [when I]<note: *Here \"[when]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"came\") which is understood as temporal> came to you, brothers, did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony<note: Some manuscripts have \"mystery\"> of God.",
    "2:2": "For I decided not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.",
    "2:3": "And I came to you in weakness and in fear and with much trembling,",
    "2:4": "and my speech and my preaching [were] not with the persuasiveness<note: Some manuscripts have \"with persuasive words\"> of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and power,",
    "2:5": "in order that your faith would not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.",
    "2:6": "Now we do speak wisdom among the mature, but wisdom not of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are perishing,",
    "2:7": "but we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a mystery, which God predestined before the ages for our glory,",
    "2:8": "which none of the rulers of this age knew. For if they had known [it], they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.",
    "2:9": "But just as it is written, \"[Things] which eye has not seen and ear has not heard, and have not entered into the heart of man, all that<note: Some manuscripts have \"which\"> God has prepared for those who love him.\"<note: A quotation from Isa 64:4>\r\n",
    "2:10": "For<note: Some manuscripts have \"But to us God has revealed [them]\"> to us God has revealed [them] through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all [things], even the depths of God.",
    "2:11": "For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man that [is] in him? Thus also no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.",
    "2:12": "Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who [is] from God, in order that we may know the things freely given to us by God,",
    "2:13": "[things] which we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in [words] taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual [things] to spiritual [people].<note: Or \"in spiritual [words]\">",
    "2:14": "But the natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he is not able to understand [them], because they are spiritually discerned.",
    "2:15": "Now the spiritual [person] discerns all [things], but he himself is judged by no one.",
    "2:16": "\"For who has known the mind of the Lord; who has advised him?\"<note: A quotation from Isa 40:13> But we have the mind of Christ.",
    "3:1": "And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual [people], but as to fleshly [people], as to infants in Christ.",
    "3:2": "I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not yet able [to eat it]. But now you are still not able,",
    "3:3": "for you are still fleshly. For where [there is] jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly, and do you not live like [unregenerate] people?<note: That is, like people who do not possess the Spirit at all>",
    "3:4": "For whenever anyone says, \"I am with Paul,\" and another, \"I [am] with Apollos,\" are you not [merely] human?",
    "3:5": "Therefore, what is Apollos and what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, and to each as the Lord gave.",
    "3:6": "I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing [it] to grow.",
    "3:7": "So then, neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but God who is causing [it] to grow.",
    "3:8": "Now the one who plants and the one who waters are one, but each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor.",
    "3:9": "For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, God's building.",
    "3:10": "According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building upon [it]. But each one must direct his attention to how he is building upon [it].",
    "3:11": "For no one is able to lay another foundation than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.",
    "3:12": "Now if anyone builds upon the foundation [with] gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, straw,",
    "3:13": "the work of each one will become evident. For the day will reveal [it], because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the work of each one, of what sort it is.",
    "3:14": "If anyone's work that he has built upon [it] remains, he will receive a reward.",
    "3:15": "If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but so as through fire.",
    "3:16": "Do you not know that you are God's temple and the Spirit of God dwells in you?",
    "3:17": "If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy this one. For God's temple is holy, which you are.",
    "3:18": "Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks [himself] to be wise among you in this age, let him become a fool, in order that he may become wise.",
    "3:19": "For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, for it is written, \"The one who catches the wise in their craftiness,\"<note: A quotation from Job 5:13>",
    "3:20": "and again, \"The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.\"<note: A quotation from Ps 94:11>",
    "3:21": "So then, let no one boast in people. For all [things] are yours,",
    "3:22": "whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come, all [things] [are] yours,",
    "3:23": "and you [are] Christ's, and Christ [is] God's.",
    "4:1": "Thus let a person consider us as servants of Christ and stewards of God's mysteries.",
    "4:2": "In this case, moreover, it is sought in stewards that one be found faithful.",
    "4:3": "But to me it is a very little matter that I be judged by you or by a human court,<note: Literally \"day\"> but I do not [even] judge myself.",
    "4:4": "For I am conscious of nothing against myself, but not by this am I vindicated. But the one who judges me is the Lord.",
    "4:5": "Therefore do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord should come, who will both enlighten the hidden things of darkness and will reveal the counsels of hearts, and then praise will come to each one from God.",
    "4:6": "Now I have applied these things, brothers, to myself and Apollos for your sake, in order that in us you may learn not [to go] beyond what is written, lest someone be inflated with pride on behalf of one [person] against the other.",
    "4:7": "For who concedes you [superiority]? And what do you have that you did not receive? But if indeed you received [it], why do you boast as [if you]<note: *Here \"[if]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"receive\") which is understood as conditional> did not receive [it]?",
    "4:8": "Already you are satiated! Already you are rich! Apart from us you reign as kings! And would that indeed you reigned as kings, in order that we also might reign as kings with you!",
    "4:9": "For, I think, God has exhibited us apostles last of all, as condemned to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world and to angels and to people.",
    "4:10": "We [are] fools for the sake of Christ, but you [are] prudent in Christ! We [are] weak, but you [are] strong! You [are] honored, but we [are] dishonored!",
    "4:11": "Until the present hour we are both hungry and thirsty and poorly clothed and roughly treated and homeless,",
    "4:12": "and we toil, working with our own hands. [When we are]<note: *Here \"[when]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"reviled\") which is understood as temporal> reviled, we bless; [when we are]<note: *Here \"[when]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"persecuted\") which is understood as temporal> persecuted, we endure;",
    "4:13": "[when we are]<note: *Here \"[when]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"slandered\") which is understood as temporal> slandered, we encourage. We have become like the refuse of the world, the offscouring of all [things], until now.",
    "4:14": "I am not writing these [things] to shame you, but admonishing [you] as my dear children.",
    "4:15": "For if you have ten thousand guardians in Christ, yet [you do] not [have] many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I fathered you through the gospel.",
    "4:16": "Therefore I exhort you, become imitators of me.",
    "4:17": "Because of this, I have sent to you Timothy, who is my dear and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ Jesus, just as I teach everywhere in every church.",
    "4:18": "But some have become arrogant, as [if] I were not coming to you.",
    "4:19": "But I am coming to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will know not the talk of the ones who have become arrogant, but the power.",
    "4:20": "For the kingdom of God [is] not with talk, but with power.",
    "4:21": "What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love and a spirit of gentleness?",
    "5:1": "It is reported everywhere [that there] is sexual immorality among you, and sexual immorality of such a kind which [does] not [even exist] among the Gentiles, so that someone has the wife of [his] father.",
    "5:2": "And you are inflated with pride, and should you not rather have mourned, so that the one who has done this deed would be removed from your midst?",
    "5:3": "For [although I]<note: *Here \"[although]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"am absent\") which is understood as concessive> am absent in body but present in spirit, I have already passed judgment on the one who has done this in this way, as [if I]<note: *Here \"[if]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"were present\") which is understood as conditional> were present.",
    "5:4": "In the name of our Lord Jesus, [when]<note: *Here \"[when]\" is supplied as a component of the temporal genitive absolute participle (\"are assembled\")> you are assembled, and my spirit, together with the power of our Lord Jesus,",
    "5:5": "[I have decided]<note: *The words \"I have decided\" are implied from the statement \"I have already passed judgment\" in v. 3> to hand over such a person to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, in order that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.",
    "5:6": "Your boasting [is] not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole batch of dough?",
    "5:7": "Clean out the old leaven in order that you may be a new batch of dough, just as you are unleavened. For Christ our Passover has been sacrificed.",
    "5:8": "So then, let us celebrate the feast, not with the old leaven or with the leaven of wickedness and sinfulness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.",
    "5:9": "I wrote to you in the letter not to associate with sexually immoral people.",
    "5:10": "By no means [did I mean] the sexually immoral people of this world or the greedy people and swindlers or idolaters, since then you would have to depart out of the world.",
    "5:11": "But now I have written to you not to associate with any so-called brother, if he is a sexually immoral person or a greedy person or an idolater or an abusive person or a drunkard or a swindler--with such a person not even to eat.",
    "5:12": "For what [is it] to me to judge those outside? Should you not judge those inside?",
    "5:13": "But those outside God will judge. Remove the evil person {from among yourselves}<note: Literally \"from you of them\">.",
    "6:1": "Does anyone among you, [if he]<note: *Here \"[if]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"has\") which is understood as conditional> has a matter against someone else, dare to go to court before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?",
    "6:2": "Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if by you the world is judged, are you unworthy of the most insignificant courts?",
    "6:3": "Do you not know that we will judge angels, not to mention ordinary matters?",
    "6:4": "Therefore, if you have courts with regard to ordinary matters, do you seat<note: Or \"seat\" (imperative); the Greek verb can be either indicative mood or imperative mood by its form> these despised [people] in the church?",
    "6:5": "I say [this] to your shame. So is there not anyone wise among you who will be able to render a decision between his brothers?",
    "6:6": "But brother goes to court with brother, and this before unbelievers!",
    "6:7": "Therefore it is already completely a loss for you that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?",
    "6:8": "But you wrong and defraud, and [do] this [to] brothers!",
    "6:9": "Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived! Neither sexually immoral people, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor passive homosexual partners, nor dominant homosexual partners,",
    "6:10": "nor thieves, nor greedy persons, not drunkards, not abusive persons, not swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.",
    "6:11": "And some of you were these [things], but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus<note: Some manuscripts have \"of the Lord Jesus Christ\"> and by the Spirit of our God.",
    "6:12": "All [things] are permitted for me, but not all [things] are profitable. All [things] are permitted for me, but I will not be controlled by anything.",
    "6:13": "Food [is] for the stomach, and the stomach for food, but God will abolish {both of them}<note: Literally \"both this and these\">. Now the body [is] not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.",
    "6:14": "And God both raised up the Lord and will raise us up by his power.",
    "6:15": "Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Therefore, shall I take away the members of Christ [and] make [them] members of a prostitute? May it never be!",
    "6:16": "Or do you not know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute is one body [with her]? For it says, \"The two will become one flesh.\"<note: A quotation from Gen 2:24>",
    "6:17": "But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit [with him].",
    "6:18": "Flee sexual immorality. Every sin that a person commits is outside his body, but the one who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.",
    "6:19": "Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit [who is] in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?",
    "6:20": "For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God with your body.",
    "7:1": "Now concerning [the things] about which you wrote: \"[It is] good for a man not to touch<note: I.e., in a sexual sense> a woman.\"",
    "7:2": "But because of sexual immorality, let each man have<note: I.e., in the sense of \"have sexual relations with\"> his own wife and let each woman have her own husband.",
    "7:3": "The husband must fulfill his obligation to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband.",
    "7:4": "The wife does not have authority over her own body, but her husband [does]. And likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body, but his wife [does].",
    "7:5": "Do not defraud one another, except perhaps by agreement, for a time, in order that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and [then] you should be {together}<note: Literally \"at the same\"> again, lest Satan tempt you because of your lack of self control.",
    "7:6": "But I say this as a concession, not as a command.",
    "7:7": "I wish all people could be like myself, but each one has his own gift from God, one in this way and another in that way.",
    "7:8": "Now I say to the unmarried and to the widows: [It is] good for them if they remain as I [am].",
    "7:9": "But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than to burn [with sexual desire].",
    "7:10": "To the married I command--not I, but the Lord--a wife must not separate from [her] husband.",
    "7:11": "But if indeed she does separate, she must remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce [his] wife.",
    "7:12": "Now to the rest I say--not the Lord--if any brother has an unbelieving wife and she consents to live with him, he must not divorce her.",
    "7:13": "And if any wife has an unbelieving husband and he consents to live with her, she must not divorce her husband.",
    "7:14": "For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by his wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the brother, since otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy.",
    "7:15": "But if the unbeliever leaves, let him leave. The brother or the sister is not bound in such [cases]. But God has called us<note: Some manuscripts have \"you\" (plural)> in peace.",
    "7:16": "For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?",
    "7:17": "But to each one as the Lord has apportioned. As God has called each one, thus let him live--and thus I order in all the churches.",
    "7:18": "Was anyone called [after]<note: *Here \"[after]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"being circumcised\") which is understood as temporal> being circumcised? He must not undo his circumcision. Was anyone called in uncircumcision? He must not become circumcised.",
    "7:19": "Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.",
    "7:20": "Each one in the calling in which he was called--in this he should remain.",
    "7:21": "Were you called [while] a slave? Do not let it be a concern to you. But if indeed you are able to become free, rather make use of [it].",
    "7:22": "For the one who is called in the Lord [while] a slave is the Lord's freedperson. Likewise the one who is called [while] free is a slave of Christ.",
    "7:23": "You were bought at a price; do not become slaves of men.",
    "7:24": "Each one in [the situation] in which he was called, brothers--in this he should remain with God.",
    "7:25": "Now concerning virgins I do not have a command from the Lord, but I am giving an opinion as one shown mercy by the Lord to be trustworthy.",
    "7:26": "Therefore, I consider this to be good because of the impending distress, that [it is] good for a man to be thus.",
    "7:27": "Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek release. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife.",
    "7:28": "But if you marry, you have not sinned, and if the virgin marries, she has not sinned. But such people will have affliction in the flesh, and I would spare you.",
    "7:29": "But I say this, brothers: the time is shortened, that from now on even those who have wives should be as [if they] do not have [wives],",
    "7:30": "and those who weep as [if they] do not weep, and those who rejoice as [if they] do not rejoice, and those who buy as [if they] do not possess,",
    "7:31": "and those who make use of the world as [if they] do not make full use of [it]. For the present form of this world is passing away.",
    "7:32": "But I want you to be free from care. The unmarried person cares for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord.",
    "7:33": "But the one who is married cares for the things of the world, how he may please his wife,",
    "7:34": "and he is divided. And the unmarried woman or the virgin cares for the things of the Lord, in order that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But the married woman cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.",
    "7:35": "Now I am saying this for your own benefit, not that I may put a restriction on you, but to promote appropriate and devoted service to the Lord without distraction.",
    "7:36": "But if anyone thinks he is behaving dishonorably concerning his virgin, if she is past her prime<note: Or \"if his passions are strong\" (it is not clear in context whether this term refers to the man or to the woman)> and it ought to be thus, let him do what he wishes. He does not sin. Let them marry.",
    "7:37": "But he who stands firm in his heart, not having necessity, but has authority concerning his own will, and has decided this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin, he will do well.",
    "7:38": "So then, the one who marries<note: Or perhaps \"the one who gives in marriage\"> his own virgin does well, and the one who does not marry [her] will do better.",
    "7:39": "A wife is bound for as long a time [as] her husband lives. But if her husband {dies}<note: Literally \"falls asleep\">, she is free to marry whomever she wishes, only in the Lord.",
    "7:40": "But she is happier if she remains thus, according to my opinion--and I think I have the Spirit of God.",
    "8:1": "Now concerning food sacrificed to idols, we know that \"we all have knowledge.\"<note: Considered by many interpreters to be a slogan used by the Corinthians to justify their behavior> Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.",
    "8:2": "If anyone thinks he knows anything, he has not yet known as it is necessary to know.",
    "8:3": "But if anyone loves God, this one is known by him.",
    "8:4": "Therefore, concerning the eating of food sacrificed to idols, we know that \"an idol [is] nothing in the world\" and that \"[there is] no God except one.\"<note: Considered by many interpreters to be slogans used by the Corinthians to justify their behavior>",
    "8:5": "For even if after all [there] are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, just as [there] are many gods and many lords,",
    "8:6": "yet to us [there is] one God, the Father, from whom [are] all [things], and we [are] for him, and [there is] one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom [are] all [things], and we [are] through him.",
    "8:7": "But this knowledge [is] not in everyone. But some, being accustomed until now to the idol, eat [this food] as food sacrificed to idols, and their conscience, [because it]<note: *Here \"[because]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"is\") which is understood as causal> is weak, is defiled.",
    "8:8": "But food does not bring us close to God. For neither if we eat do we have more, nor if we do not eat do we lack.<note: Some manuscripts omit \"For\" and have \"Neither if we do not eat do we lack, nor if we do eat do we have more\">",
    "8:9": "But watch out lest somehow this right of yours becomes a cause for stumbling to the weak.",
    "8:10": "For if someone should see you who has knowledge reclining for a meal in an idol's temple, will not his conscience, [because it]<note: *Here \"[because]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"is\") which is understood as causal> is weak, be strengthened so that [he] eats the food sacrificed to idols?",

    "14:31": "For you are all able to prophesy {in turn}<note: Literally \"one at a time>, in order that all may learn and all may be encouraged,",
    "14:32": "and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.",
    "14:33": "For God is not [a God of] disorder but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,\r\n",
    "14:34": "the women must be silent in the churches, for it is not permitted for them to speak, but they must be in submission, just as the law also says.",
    "14:35": "But if they want to learn something, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.",
    "14:36": "Or has the word of God gone out from you, or has it come to you only?",
    "14:37": "If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual,<note: Or \"or one who possesses the Spirit\"> he should recognize that [the things] which I am writing to you are of the Lord.<note: Some manuscripts have \"are a command of the Lord\">",
    "14:38": "But if anyone ignores [this], he is ignored.<note: Or \"if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant\">",
    "14:39": "So then, my brothers, desire to prophesy, and do not prevent speaking with tongues.",
    "14:40": "But let all [things] be [done] decently and according to proper procedure.",
    "15:1": "Now I make known to you, brothers, the gospel which I proclaimed to you, which you have also received, in which you also stand,",
    "15:2": "by which you are also being saved, if you hold fast to the message I proclaimed to you, unless you believed to no purpose.",
    "15:3": "For I passed on to you {as of first importance}<note: Literally \"among the first [things]\"> what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures,",
    "15:4": "and that he was buried, and that he was raised up on the third day according to the scriptures,",
    "15:5": "and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve,",
    "15:6": "then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once, the majority of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep.",
    "15:7": "Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles,",
    "15:8": "and last of all, as it were to one born at the wrong time, he appeared also to me.",
    "15:9": "For I am the least of the apostles, not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.",
    "15:10": "But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me has not been in vain, but I labored even more than all of them, and not I, but the grace of God with me.",
    "15:11": "Therefore whether I or those, in this way we preached, and in this way you believed.",
    "15:12": "Now if Christ is preached as raised up from the dead, how do some among you say that [there] is no resurrection of the dead?",
    "15:13": "But if [there] is no resurrection of the dead, Christ has not been raised [either].",
    "15:14": "But if Christ has not been raised, then<note: Some manuscripts have \"then both\"> our preaching [is] in vain, and your faith [is] in vain.",
    "15:15": "And also we are found [to be] false witnesses of God, because we testified against God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if after all, then, the dead are not raised.",
    "15:16": "For if the dead are not raised, Christ has not been raised [either].",
    "15:17": "But if Christ has not been raised, your faith [is] empty; you are still in your sins.",
    "15:18": "And as a further result, those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.",
    "15:19": "If {we have put our hope}<note: Literally \"we are having put our hope\"> in Christ in this life only, we are of all people most pitiable.",
    "15:20": "But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.",
    "15:21": "For since through a man [came] death, also through a man [came] the resurrection of the dead.",
    "15:22": "For just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.",
    "15:23": "But each in his own group: Christ the first fruits, then those [who are] Christ's at his coming,",
    "15:24": "then the end, when he hands over the kingdom to the God and Father, when he has abolished all rule and all authority and power.",
    "15:25": "For it is necessary for him to reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.",
    "15:26": "The last enemy to be abolished [is] death.",
    "15:27": "For \"he subjected all [things] under his feet.\"<note: A quotation from Ps 8:6> But when it says \"all [things]\" are subjected, [it is] clear that the one who subjected all [things] to him [is] not included.",
    "15:28": "But whenever all [things] are subjected to him, then the Son himself will be subjected<note: Some manuscripts have \"also will be subjected\"> to the one who subjected all [things] to him, in order that God may be all in all.",
    "15:29": "Otherwise, why do they do [it], those who are being baptized on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why indeed are they being baptized on behalf of them?",
    "15:30": "And why are we in danger every hour?",
    "15:31": "I die every day--yes indeed, by my boasting in you,<note: Some manuscripts have \"in you, brothers,\"> which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord!",
    "15:32": "If according to a human perspective I fought wild beasts at Ephesus, what benefit [is it] to me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.<note: An allusion to Isa 22:13; 56:12>",
    "15:33": "Do not be deceived! \"Bad company corrupts good morals.\"<note: A quotation from the Greek poet Menander's comedy Thais, 218>",
    "15:34": "Sober up correctly and {stop sinning}<note: Literally \"do not sin\">, for some have no knowledge of God--I say [this] to your shame.",
    "15:35": "But someone will say, \"How are the dead raised? And with what sort of body do they come?\"",
    "15:36": "Foolish person! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.",
    "15:37": "And what you sow [is] not the body which it will become, but you sow the bare seed, whether perhaps of wheat or of some of the rest.",
    "15:38": "But God gives to it a body just as he wishes, and to each one of the seeds its own body.",
    "15:39": "Not all flesh [is] the same, but [there is] one flesh of human beings, and another flesh of animals, and another flesh of birds, and another of fish,",
    "15:40": "and heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. But the glory of the heavenly [bodies] [is] of one kind, and the [glory] of the earthly [bodies] [is] of another kind.",
    "15:41": "[There is] one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars, for star differs from star in glory.",
    "15:42": "Thus also [is] the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruptibility.",
    "15:43": "It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.",
    "15:44": "It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If [there] is a natural body, [there] is also a spiritual [body].",
    "15:45": "Thus also it is written, \"The first man, Adam, became a living soul\";<note: A quotation from Gen 2:7> the last Adam [became] a life-giving spirit.",
    "15:46": "But the spiritual [is] not first, but the natural; then the spiritual.",
    "15:47": "The first man [is] from the earth, made of earth; the second man [is] from heaven.",
    "15:48": "As the one [who is] made of earth, so also [are] those [who are] made of earth, and as the heavenly, so also [are] those [who are] heavenly.",
    "15:49": "And just as we have borne the image of the [one who is] made of earth, we will also bear the image of the heavenly.",
    "15:50": "But I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood is not able to inherit the kingdom of God, nor can corruption inherit incorruptibility.",
    "15:51": "Behold, I tell you a mystery: we will not all fall asleep, but we will all be changed,",
    "15:52": "in a moment, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.",
    "15:53": "For it is necessary [for] this perishable [body] to put on incorruptibility, and this mortal [body] to put on immortality.",
    "15:54": "But whenever this perishable [body] puts on incorruptibility and this mortal [body] puts on immortality, then the saying that is written will take place: \"Death is swallowed up in victory.\r\n",
    "15:55": "Where, O death, [is] your victory? Where, O death, [is] your sting?",
    "15:56": "Now the sting of death [is] sin, and the power of sin [is] the law.",
    "15:57": "But thanks [be] to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!",
    "15:58": "So then, my dear brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, [because you]<note: *Here \"[because]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"know\") which is understood as causal> know that your labor is not [in] vain in the Lord.",
    "16:1": "Now concerning the collection for the saints: just as I gave directions about [it] to the churches of Galatia, so you do also.",
    "16:2": "On the first [day] of the week, each one of you {put aside}<note: Literally \"put from himself\"> [something], saving up {to whatever extent he has prospered}<note: Literally \"whatever if anything he has been prospered\">, in order that whenever I come, at that time collections do not take place.",
    "16:3": "And whenever I arrive, whomever you approve by letters, I will send these to take your gift to Jerusalem.",
    "16:4": "And if it is worthwhile for me to go also, they will travel with me.",
    "16:5": "But I will come to you whenever I go through Macedonia (for I am going through Macedonia),",
    "16:6": "and perhaps I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, so that you may send me on my way wherever I may go.",
    "16:7": "For I do not want to see you now in passing, for I hope to remain some time with you, if the Lord allows [it].",
    "16:8": "But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost,",
    "16:9": "for a great and effective door has opened for me, and [there are] many opponents.",
    "16:10": "But if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without cause to fear, for he is carrying out the Lord's work, as I also [am].",
    "16:11": "Therefore do not let anyone disdain him, but send him [on his way] in peace in order that he may come to me, for I am expecting him with the brothers.",
    "16:12": "Now concerning Apollos our brother, I urged him many [times] that he should come to you with the brothers, and he was not at all willing that he should come now, but he will come whenever he has [an] opportunity.",
    "16:13": "Be on the alert, stand firm in the faith, act courageously, be strong.",
    "16:14": "All your [actions] must be done in love.",
    "16:15": "Now I urge you, brothers--you know about the household of Stephanas, that they are the first fruits of Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the ministry for the saints--",
    "16:16": "that you also be subject to such people, and to all those who work together and labor.",
    "16:17": "Now I rejoice over the arrival of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because these make up for your absence,",
    "16:18": "for they have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore recognize such people.",
    "16:19": "The churches of [the province of] Asia<note: That is, the Roman province of Asia, known today as Asia Minor> greet you. Aquila and Prisca greet you in the Lord many [times], together with the church in their house.",
    "16:20": "All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.",
    "16:21": "The greeting [is] by my hand--Paul's.",
    "16:22": "If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be accursed. O Lord, come!<note: The Aramaic expression marana tha (\"O Lord, come!\") can also be rendered maran atha (\"our Lord has come\"); it is used here by Paul without explanation>",
