    "1:2": "{May<note: In the maiden's soliloquy, she thinks about her beloved in her thoughts (\"May he kiss me!\"), then poetically speaks to him as if he were in her presence (\"for your love is better than wine\"). To avoid confusion, the translation uses the second-person form throughout vv. 2-4> you kiss me}<note: Literally \"May he kiss me\"> {passionately with your lips},<note: Literally \"with the kisses of his mouth\"> for your love [is] better than wine.<note: The shift from the third person \"he ... his\" to the second person \"you ... your\" in vv. 2-4 should not be interpreted as suggesting two different referents, that is, one male whom the maiden is addressing as \"you,\" and another to whom she refers as \"he.\" Rather, this shift is a poetic device (called \"grammatical differentiation\") that is not uncommon in Hebrew poetry (e.g., Gen 49:4; Deut 32:15; Psa 23:2-5; Isa 1:29; 42:20; 54:1; Jer 22:24; Amos 4:1; Mic 7:19; Lam 3:1; Song 4:2; 6:6). This shift is characteristic of a soliloquy, a dramatic or literary form in which a character reveals her thoughts without addressing a listener who is actually present (e.g., 2 Sam 19:4). In this case, the maiden's private thoughts about her beloved (v. 2a) shift to an imaginary address to her beloved (vv. 2b-4a)>",

However, several ancient versions (Syriac Peshitta, Latin Vulgate, Symmachus) reflect an alternate Hebrew textual tradition in which two letters are transposed, resulting in the reading \"like one who wanders about.\" This makes good sense contextually, since the maiden does not know where her beloved would be at noon> beside the flocks of your companions?",
