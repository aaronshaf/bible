    "4:11": "Then our enemies said, \"They will not know nor see until we come upon them and will kill them and stop the work.\"",
    "4:12": "When the Jews who lived beside them came, they said to us ten times, \"From all of the places where they live, [they will come up] against us.\"",
    "4:13": "I stationed the people behind the deepest part of the wall in the open places according to their families, with their swords, spears, and bows.",

    "4:15": "It happened when our enemies heard that their plan was known to us, that God had frustrated [it], and we all returned to the wall--each to his work.",
    "4:16": "From that day, half of my servants were working on craftsmanship, half were holding spears, small shields, bows, and breastplates. The commanders were behind the whole house of Judah.",
    "4:17": "The ones who were building the wall and the ones {who carried the materials}<note: Literally \"who carried the burden\"> were carrying in one hand while doing the task, and with the other hand were grasping a weapon.",

    "4:20": "Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, come together to us there. Our God will fight for us.\"",
    "4:21": "So we labored at the work, and half of them were holding the spears from dawn until the stars came out.",
    "4:22": "At the time I also said to the people, \"Let each man and his servant spend the night inside Jerusalem, so that they will be a guard for us in the night and work in the day.\"",
    "4:23": "So neither I nor my brothers nor my young men nor the men of the guard who were behind me took off our clothes. Each one [kept] his weapon [even] in the water.",
    "5:1": "Now there was a great cry of distress of the people and of their wives [against] their Jewish brothers.",

    "5:3": "There were also those saying, \"We have pledged our fields and our vineyards and our houses so that we can get grain in the famine.\"",
    "5:4": "And there were those who were saying, \"We have borrowed money on our fields and our vineyards for the tax of the king.",
    "5:5": "Now our flesh is like the flesh of our brothers, our sons are like their sons.

    "5:6": "I was very angry when I heard their shouts and these words.",
    "5:7": "I thought over this in my heart, and then I quarreled with the nobles and the prefects. I said to them, \"You yourselves are taking interest from your own brother!\" So I called the great assembly against them,",
    "5:8": "and I said to them: \"We ourselves have bought back our brothers the Jews who were sold to the nations as we were able. But now you yourselves have sold your brothers so they may be sold to us!\" They were silent and could not find a word [to say].",
    "5:9": "So I said, \"The thing that you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God [to prevent] the disgrace from the nations, our enemies?",
    "5:10": "Also, I and my brothers and my servants are lending them money and grain. Please stop [taking] this interest.",
    "5:11": "Please restore to them this day their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves, their houses, and the interest on the money, the grain, the grape juice, and the olive oil that you have been taking from them.\"",
    "5:12": "So they said, \"We will restore it and will not request [anything more]. So we will do as you say.\" Then I called the priests and made them take an oath to do this promise.",
    "5:13": "I also shook out my garment and said, \"This is how God will shake out everyone from his house who will not keep this promise. So this is how his possessions will be shaken out and emptied.\" And all the assembly said, \"Amen!\" And they praised Yahweh, and the people kept this promise.",
    "5:14": "Moreover, from the appointed day I was made their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year until the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes--twelve years. My brothers and I did not eat the food [allowance] of the governor.",
    "5:15": "The former governors who were before me laid burdens on the people, and they took food and wine from them, besides forty shekels. Also, their servants controlled the people, but I did not do so because of the fear of God.",
    "5:16": "I also devoted myself to the work of this wall, and we did not buy land. All of my servants were gathered for the work.",
    "5:17": "One hundred and fifty men, prefects and Jews, and those who came to us from the nations around us, [were] at my table.",
    "5:18": "Now what was prepared each day for me was one ox, six choice sheep, and birds. And every ten days all [kinds of] wine were made. But for this I did not demand the food [allowance] of the governor because the slavery was too heavy on this people.",
    "5:19": "Remember me for good, my God, all that I have done for this people.",
    "6:1": "Now when it was reported to Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and to the rest of our enemies that I had built the wall and that no gap was left in it--though up to that time I had not erected doors in the gates--",
    "6:2": "Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, \"Come and let us meet together in [one of] the villages in the plain of Ono.\" But they planned to do evil to me.",
    "6:3": "So I sent messengers to them, saying, \"I am doing a great work and I am not able to come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you all?\"",
    "6:4": "And they sent a message to me four times like this, and I returned an answer like this to them.",
    "6:5": "And Sanballat sent his servant with an open letter, [another] word like this to me a fifth time, in his hand.",
    "6:6": "In it was written, \"It has been reported among the nations, and Gashmu also is saying it, that you and the Jews are considering rebellion. Therefore, truly you are building the wall and you are becoming their king, according to these words.",
    "6:7": "You have also set up prophets to proclaim in Jerusalem concerning you, saying, '[There is] a king in Judah.' And now it will be proclaimed to the king according to these words. Now, come and we will plan together.\"",
    "6:8": "So I sent to him saying, \"None of these words you have spoken has happened. You are indeed saying [things] created in your own mind\"--",
    "6:9": "for all of them [sought] to frighten us, saying, \"their hands will not do the work.\" And now, [God], strengthen my hands.",
    "6:10": "Now I went into the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was confined [at home], and he said, \"Let us meet in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple; for they are coming to kill you--during the night they are coming to kill you.\"",
    "6:11": "But I said, \"Should a man like me run away? And would a man like me go into the temple so that he can save his life? I will not go in!\"",
    "6:12": "Then I look and realized God had not sent him; rather, he had spoken the prophecy against me [because] Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.",
    "6:13": "For this reason he was hired: to frighten [me] so that I would act and sin, so that they would have a bad report so they could taunt me.",
    "6:14": "Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to their works, and also Noadiah the prophetess, and the remainder of the prophets who were frightening me.",
    "6:15": "So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of Elul, in fifty-two days.",
    "6:16": "When our enemies heard of this, all of the nations surrounding us were afraid and {lost their confidence}.<note: Literally \"fell much in their eyes\"> They knew that this work had been done with [the help of] our God.",
    "6:17": "Also, in those days the nobles of Judah increasingly sent their letters to Tobiah, and [letters] from Tobiah returned to them.",
    "6:18": "For many in Judah were bound by oath to him because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah. His son Jehohanan took as a wife the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah.",
    "6:19": "They also were speaking of his good deeds in my presence, and they were sending my words out to him. Tobiah sent letters to intimidate me.",
    "7:1": "Now when the wall had been built and I had erected the doors and appointed the gatekeepers, singers, and the Levites,",
    "7:2": "I gave command over Jerusalem to my brother Hanani and Hananiah the commander of the citadel. For he was a faithful man and feared God more than many.",
    "7:3": "I said to them, \"Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until the sun is hot. While they are standing guard let them shut and fasten the doors. And appoint guards from the inhabitants of Jerusalem, one at his post and another opposite his house.\"",
    "7:4": "The city [was] widespread and large, but the people in it were few and no houses were rebuilt.",
    "7:5": "Then my God put into my heart to assemble the nobles, the prefects, and the people to be enrolled. I found the book of the genealogy of those who first came back, and I found [this] written upon it:",
    "7:6": "These are the people of the province who came up from captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried into exile. They returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, each one to his city.",
    "7:7": "These came with Zerubbabel, Joshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:\r\n",

    "12:45": "They kept the responsibility of their God and the responsibility of cleansing, and the singers and gatekeepers, according to the command of David and his son Solomon.",
    "12:46": "For in the days of David and Asaph from ancient times there was the head of the singers and a song of praise and thanksgiving to God.",
    "12:47": "So all of Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah gave the daily food portions of the singers and gatekeepers. And they set apart [that which was for] the Levites, and the Levites set apart [that which was for] the descendants<note: Or \"sons\"> of Aaron.",
    "13:1": "On that day the book of Moses was read in the hearing of the people and it was found written in it that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever come into the assembly of God",
    "13:2": "because they did not come to meet the {Israelites}<note: Literally \"sons/children of Israel\"> with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them in order to curse them--but our God changed the curse into a blessing.",
    "13:3": "So it happened when they heard the law<note: Hebrew torah> that they separated all of the foreign people from Israel.",
    "13:4": "Before this, Eliashib the priest who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God--the one related to Tobiah--",
    "13:5": "prepared for [Tobiah] a large chamber where they had formerly put the grain offering, the frankincense, the [temple] objects, tithes of grain, wine, and oil commanded for the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the offerings of the priests.",
    "13:6": "During all of this, I was not in Jerusalem because in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went to the king. At the end of [some] days I asked permission from the king [to leave].",
    "13:7": "So I came to Jerusalem. And I came to learn of the wrong that Eliashib had done for Tobiah by making him a room in the courtyard of the house of God.",
    "13:8": "It was very displeasing for me, and I threw all of the objects from the house of Tobiah outside of the chamber.",
    "13:9": "And I spoke [in order], and they cleansed the chambers. Then I returned the objects of the house of God--the grain offering and the frankincense.",
    "13:10": "And then I came to learn that the food of the Levites had not been given to them, so that the Levites and the singers, the doers of the work, had gone back each to his field.",
    "13:11": "So I quarreled with the prefects, and I said, \"Why is the house of God forsaken?\" And I gathered them and set them at their station.",
    "13:12": "So all of Judah brought the tithe of grain, new wine, and olive oil into the storehouses.",
    "13:13": "I appointed as treasurer over the storehouses Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, Pedaiah from the Levites, and as their hand Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah, for they were considered faithful. [The responsibility given] to them was to distribute to their brothers.",
    "13:14": "Remember me, my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my loyal acts which I have done in the house of my God and in his service.",
    "13:15": "In those days I saw in Judah [people] treading the wine press on the Sabbath, bringing in heaps [of grain] and loading them on donkeys along with wine, grapes and figs, and every kind of burden and bringing [it all] to Jerusalem on the day of the Sabbath. And I warned them at that time against selling food.",
    "13:16": "Tyrian men who lived in [Jerusalem] brought fish and every kind of merchandise and sold [it] on the Sabbath to the descendants<note: Or \"sons\"> of Judah and in Jerusalem.",
    "13:17": "So I quarreled with the nobles of Judah and said to them, \"What is this evil thing that you are doing, profaning the day of the Sabbath?",
    "13:18": "Did not your ancestors<note: Or \"fathers\"> do this also, and our God brought on us all of this disaster and on this city [too]? Now you are adding fierce wrath on Israel by profaning the Sabbath!\"",
    "13:19": "So when it became dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors be shut and said that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. And I appointed some of my young men over the gates [to prevent] any {goods}<note: Literally \"burden\"> being brought in on the day of the Sabbath.",
    "13:20": "So the merchants and the sellers of merchandise spent the night outside of Jerusalem once or twice.",
    "13:21": "But I warned them and said to them, \"Why are you spending the night opposite the wall? If you do [it again], I will lay hands against you.\" From that time on they did not come on the Sabbath.",
    "13:22": "And then I told two Levites that they must purify themselves and come to guard the gates in order to consecrate the day of the Sabbath. Remember this also, my God, and take pity on me according to the greatness of your loyal love.",
    "13:23": "Also in those days I saw Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab.",
    "13:24": "Half of their children spoke Ashdodite and could not speak Judean, but [only] the tongues of other nations.",
    "13:25": "So I quarreled with them and cursed them and beat some of their men and pulled out their hair. I made them take an oath by God: \"Do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves.",
    "13:26": "Did not King Solomon of Israel sin in this way? And among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was beloved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Yet the foreign women made even him sin.",
    "13:27": "Should we listen to you all and do this great evil, acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign women?\"",
    "13:28": "One from the sons of Jehoiada, son of the high priest Eliashib, [who was] the son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonote [was there]. I chased him away from me.",
    "13:29": "Remember them, my God, because of their defilements of the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.",
    "13:30": "So I cleansed them from everything foreign, and I established responsibilities for the priests and Levites, each in his own work,",
    "13:31": "a contribution of the wood offering at appointed times, and for the first fruits. Remember me, my God, for good."
