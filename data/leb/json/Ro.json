    "1:7": "To all those in Rome who are loved by God, called [to be] saints. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.",
    "1:8": "First, I give thanks to my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being proclaimed in the whole world.",
    "1:9": "For God, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, is my witness, how constantly I make mention of you,",
    "1:10": "always asking in my prayers if somehow now at last I may succeed to come to you in the will of God.",
    "1:11": "For I desire to see you, in order that I may impart some spiritual gift to you, in order to strengthen you,",
    "1:12": "that is, to be encouraged together with you through {our mutual faith}<note: Literally \"the in one another faith\">, both yours and mine.",
    "1:13": "Now I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, that often I intended to come to you, and was prevented until now, in order that I might have some fruit among you also, just as also among the rest of the Gentiles.<note: Or \"nations\"; the same Greek word can be translated \"nations\" or \"Gentiles\" depending on the context>",
    "1:14": "I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.",
    "1:15": "Thus {I am eager}<note: Literally \"the according to me eagerness\"> to proclaim the gospel also to you who [are] in Rome.",
    "1:16": "For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.",
    "1:17": "For the righteousness of God is revealed in it from faith to faith, just as it is written, \"But the one who is righteous by faith will live.\"<note: Or \"But the one who is righteous will live by faith\" (differing only in word order)>",
    "1:18": "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all impiety and unrighteousness of people, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,",
    "1:19": "because what can be known about God is evident among<note: Or \"in\"; or \"within\"> them, for God made [it] clear to them.",
    "1:20": "For from the creation of the world, his invisible [attributes], both his eternal power and deity, are discerned clearly, being understood in the things created, so that they are without excuse.",
    "1:21": "For [although they] knew God, they did not honor [him] as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their reasoning, and their senseless hearts were darkened.",
    "1:22": "Claiming to be wise, they became fools,",
    "1:23": "and exchanged the glory of the immortal God with the likeness of an image of mortal human beings and birds and quadrupeds and reptiles.",
    "1:24": "Therefore God gave them over in the desires of their hearts to immorality, [that] their bodies would be dishonored among themselves,",
    "1:25": "who exchanged the truth of God with a lie, and worshiped and served the creation rather than the Creator, who is blessed for eternity. Amen.",
    "1:26": "Because of this, God gave them over to degrading passions, for their females exchanged the natural relations for those contrary to nature,",
    "1:27": "and likewise also the males, abandoning the natural relations with the female, were inflamed in their desire toward one another, males with males committing the shameless deed, and receiving in themselves the penalty that was necessary for their error.",
    "1:28": "And just as they did not see fit {to recognize God}<note: Literally \"to have God in recognition\">, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do the things [that are] not proper,",
    "1:29": "being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greediness, malice, full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malevolence. [They are] gossipers,",

    "2:1": "Therefore you are without excuse, O man, every one [of you] who passes judgment. For in that which you pass judgment on someone else, you condemn yourself, for you who are passing judgment are doing the same [things].",
    "2:2": "Now we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who do such things.",
    "2:3": "But do you think this, O man who passes judgment on those who do such things, and who does the same [things], that you will escape the judgment of God?",
    "2:4": "Or do you despise the wealth of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?",
    "2:5": "But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart, you are storing up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God,",
    "2:6": "who will reward each one according to his works:",
    "2:7": "to those who, by perseverance in good work, seek glory and honor and immortality, eternal life,",

    "2:10": "but glory and honor and peace to everyone who does good, to the Jew first and to the Greek.",
    "2:11": "For [there] is no partiality with God.",
    "2:12": "For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without law, and as many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.",
    "2:13": "For it is not the hearers of the law [who are] righteous in the sight of God, but the doers of the law will be declared righteous.<note: Or \"will be justified\">",
    "2:14": "For whenever the Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature the things of the law, these, [although they]<note: *Here \"[although]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"have\") which is understood as concessive> do not have the law, are a law to themselves,",

    "2:17": "But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God",
    "2:18": "and know his will and approve the things that are superior, [because you]<note: *Here \"[because]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"are instructed\") which is understood as causal> are instructed by the law,",

    "2:22": "The one who says not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? The one who abhors idols, do you rob temples?",
    "2:23": "Who boast in the law, by the transgression of the law you dishonor God!<note: Or \"do you dishonor God?\" (a number of translators and interpreters take this phrase as a final rhetorical question; the present translation regards it as a final summary statement to be taken ironically)>",
    "2:24": "For just as it is written, \"The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.\"<note: A quotation from Isa 52:5>",
    "2:25": "For circumcision is of value if you do the law, but if you should be a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.",
    "2:26": "Therefore, if the uncircumcised person follows the requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be credited for circumcision?",
    "2:27": "And the uncircumcised person by nature who carries out the law will judge you who, [though provided] with {the precise written code}<note: Literally \"the letter\"> and circumcision [are] a transgressor of the law.",
    "2:28": "For the Jew is not {one outwardly}<note: Literally \"in the open\">, nor [is] circumcision {outwardly}<note: Literally \"in the open\">, in the flesh.",
    "2:29": "But the Jew {is one inwardly}<note: Literally \"in secret\">, and circumcision [is] of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter, whose praise [is] not from people but from God.",
    "3:1": "Therefore, what [is] the advantage of the Jew, or what [is] the use of circumcision?",
    "3:2": "Much in every way. For first, that they were entrusted with the oracles of God.",
    "3:3": "{What is the result}<note: Literally \"for what\"> if some refused to believe? Their unbelief will not nullify the faithfulness of God, [will it]?",
    "3:4": "May it never be! But let God be true but every human being a liar, just as it is written, \"In order that you may be justified in your words, and may prevail when you are<note: *Or, if the form is understood as middle voice, \"when you yourself judge\"> judged.\"<note: A quotation from Ps 51:4>\r\n",
    "3:5": "But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? God, who inflicts wrath, [is] not unjust, [is he]? (I am speaking according to a human perspective.)",
    "3:6": "May it never be! For otherwise, how will God judge the world?",
    "3:7": "But if by my lying, the truth of God abounded to his glory, why am I also still condemned as a sinner?",
    "3:8": "And [why] not (as we are slandered, and as some affirm that we say), \"Let us do evil, in order that good may come [of it]? Their<note: Literally \"whose\"> condemnation is just!",

    "3:19": "Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those under the law, in order that every mouth may be closed and the whole world may become accountable to God.",
    "3:20": "For by the works of the law {no person will be declared righteous}<note: Literally \"all flesh will not be declared righteous\"> before him, for through the law [comes] knowledge of sin.",
    "3:21": "But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, being testified about by the law and the prophets--",
    "3:22": "that is, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ<note: Or \"through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ\"> to all who believe. For [there] is no distinction,",
    "3:23": "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,",

    "3:25": "whom God made publicly available as the mercy seat<note: Or \"as the place of propitiation\"> through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness, because of the passing over of previously committed sins,",
    "3:26": "in the forbearance of God, for the demonstration of his righteousness in the present time, so that he should be just and the one who justifies the [person] by faith<note: Or \"by Jesus' faithfulness\"> in Jesus.",
    "3:27": "Therefore, where [is] boasting? It has been excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law<note: Or \"a principle\"> of faith.",
    "3:28": "For we consider a person to be justified by faith apart from the works of the law.",
    "3:29": "Or [is God] the God of the Jews only? [Is he] not also [the God] of the Gentiles? Yes, also of the Gentiles,",
    "3:30": "since God [is] one, who will justify {those who are circumcised}<note: Literally \"circumcision\"> by faith and {those who are uncircumcised}<note: Literally \"uncircumcision\"> through faith.",
    "3:31": "Therefore, do we nullify the law through faith? May it never be! But we uphold the law.",
    "4:1": "What then shall we say [that] Abraham, our ancestor according to the flesh, has found?",
    "4:2": "For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.",
    "4:3": "For what does the scripture say? \"And Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness.\"<note: A quotation from Gen 15:6>",
    "4:4": "Now to the one who works, his pay is not credited according to grace, but according to his due.",
    "4:5": "But to the one who does not work, but who believes in the one who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited for righteousness,",
    "4:6": "just as David also speaks about the blessing of the person to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:",
    "4:7": "\"Blessed [are they] whose lawless deeds have been forgiven, and whose sins are covered over.",
    "4:8": "Blessed [is] the person against whom the Lord will never count sin.\"<note: A quotation from Ps 32:1-2>",
    "4:9": "Therefore, [is] this blessing for {those who are circumcised}<note: Literally \"the circumcision\">, or also for {those who are uncircumcised}<note: Literally \"the uncircumcision\">? For we say, \"Faith was credited to Abraham for righteousness.\"<note: A quotation from Gen 15:6>",
    "4:10": "How then was it credited? [While he]<note: *Here \"[while]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"was\") which is understood as temporal> was {circumcised}<note: Literally \"in circumcision\"> or {uncircumcised}<note: Literally \"in uncircumcision\">? Not {while circumcised}<note: Literally \"in circumcision\"> but {while uncircumcised}<note: Literally \"in uncircumcision\">!",
    "4:11": "And he received the sign of circumcision [as] a seal<note: Or \"confirmation\"> of the righteousness by faith which [he had] {while uncircumcised}<note: Literally \"in uncircumcision\">, so that he could be the father of all who believe {although they are uncircumcised}<note: Literally \"through uncircumcision\">, so that righteousness could be credited to them,<note: Some manuscripts have \"could be credited to them also\">",

    "4:13": "For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants, [that] he would be heir of the world, [was] not through the law, but through the righteousness by faith.",
    "4:14": "For if those of the law [are] heirs, faith is rendered void and the promise is nullified.",
    "4:15": "For the law produces wrath, but where [there] is no law, neither [is there] transgression.",
    "4:16": "Because of this, [it is] by faith, in order that [it may be] according to grace, so that the promise may be secure to all the descendants, not only to those of the law, but also to those of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all",
    "4:17": "(just as it is written, \"I have made you the father of many nations\")<note: A quotation from Gen 17:5> before God, in whom he believed, the one who makes the dead alive and who calls the things that are not as [though] they are,",
    "4:18": "who against hope believed in hope, so that he became the father of many nations, according to what was said, \"so will your descendants be.\"<note: A quotation from Gen 15:5>",
    "4:19": "And not being weak in faith, he considered his own body as good as dead, <note: Some manuscripts have \"already as good as dead\"> [because he]<note: *Here \"[because]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"was\") which is understood as causal> was approximately a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah's womb.",
    "4:20": "And he did not waver in unbelief at the promise of God, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God",
    "4:21": "and being fully convinced that what he had promised, he was also able to do.",
    "4:22": "Therefore<note: Some manuscripts have \"Therefore, indeed,\"> it was credited to him for righteousness.",
    "4:23": "But it was not written for the sake of him alone that it was credited to him,",
    "4:24": "but also for the sake of us to whom it is going to be credited, to those who believe in the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,",
    "4:25": "who was handed over on account of our trespasses, and was raised up in the interest of our justification.<note: Or \"vindication\"; or \"acquittal\">",
    "5:1": "Therefore, [because we]<note: *Here \"[because]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"have been declared righteous\") which is understood as causal> have been declared righteous by faith, we have<note: Although a number of important manuscripts read the subjunctive mood here (\"let us have\"), almost all English versions prefer the indicative mood (\"we have\") which is supported by many other manuscripts> peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,",
    "5:2": "through whom also we have [obtained] access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we boast in the hope of the glory of God.",
    "5:3": "And not only [this], but we also boast in our afflictions, [because we]<note: *Here \"[because]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"know\") which is understood as causal> know that affliction produces patient endurance,",
    "5:4": "and patient endurance, proven character, and proven character, hope,",
    "5:5": "and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.",
    "5:6": "For [while]<note: *Here \"[while]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"were\") which is understood as temporal> we were still helpless, yet at the proper time Christ died for the ungodly.",
    "5:7": "For only rarely will someone die on behalf of a righteous person (for on behalf of a good person possibly someone might even dare to die),",
    "5:8": "but God demonstrates his own love for us, [in] that [while]<note: *Here \"[while]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"were\") which is understood as temporal> we were still sinners, Christ died for us.",
    "5:9": "Therefore, by much more, [because we]<note: *Here \"[because]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"have been declared righteous\") which is understood as causal> have been declared righteous now by his blood, we will be saved through him from the wrath.",
    "5:10": "For if, [while we]<note: *Here \"[while]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"were\") which is understood as temporal> were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, by much more, having been reconciled, we will be saved by his life.",
    "5:11": "And not only [this], but also [we are] boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.",
    "5:12": "Because of this, just as sin entered into the world through one man, and death through sin, so also death spread to all people because all sinned.",
    "5:13": "For until the law, sin was in the world, but sin is not charged to one's account [when there]<note: *Here \"[when]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"is\") which is understood as temporal> is no law.",
    "5:14": "But death reigned from Adam until Moses even over those who did not sin in the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is a type of the one who is to come.",
    "5:15": "{But the gift is not like the trespass}<note: Literally \"but not like the trespass so also the gift\">, for if by the trespass of the one, the many died, by much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, multiply to the many.",
    "5:16": "And the gift [is] not as through the one who sinned, for on the one hand, judgment from the one [sin] [led] to condemnation, but the gift, from many trespasses, [led] to justification.",
    "5:17": "For if by the trespass of the one [man], death reigned through the one [man], much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ.",
    "5:18": "Consequently therefore, as through one trespass [came] condemnation to all people, so also through one righteous deed [came] justification of life to all people.",
    "5:19": "For just as through the disobedience of the one man, the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one, the many will be made righteous.",
    "5:20": "Now the law came in as a side issue, in order that the trespass could increase, but where sin increased, grace was present in greater abundance,",
    "5:21": "so that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.",
    "6:1": "What therefore shall we say? Shall we continue in sin, in order that grace may increase?",
    "6:2": "May it never be! How can we who died to sin still live in it?",
    "6:3": "Or do you not know that as many as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?",
    "6:4": "Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we may live {a new way of life}<note: Literally \"in newness of life\">.",
    "6:5": "For if we have become identified with [him] in the likeness of his death, certainly also we will be [identified with him in the likeness]<note: The elliptical phrase \"identified with him in the likeness\" has been supplied in the translation for clarity> of [his] resurrection,",
    "6:6": "knowing this, that our old man was crucified together with [him], in order that the body of sin may be done away with, [that] we may no longer be enslaved to sin.",
    "6:7": "For the one who has died has been freed from sin.",
    "6:8": "Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him,",
    "6:9": "knowing that Christ, [because he]<note: *Here \"[because]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"has been raised\") which is understood as causal> has been raised from the dead, is going to die no more, death no longer being master over him.",
    "6:10": "For that [death] he died, he died to sin once and never again, but that [life] he lives, he lives to God.",
    "6:11": "So also you, consider yourselves to be dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.",
    "6:12": "Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, so that [you] obey its desires,",
    "6:13": "and do not present your members to sin [as] instruments of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who are alive from the dead, and your members to God [as] instruments of righteousness.",
    "6:14": "For sin will not be master over you, because you are not under law, but under grace.",
    "6:15": "What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? May it never be!",
    "6:16": "Do you not know that to whomever you present yourselves [as] slaves for obedience, you are slaves to whomever you obey, whether sin, [leading] to death, or obedience, [leading] to righteousness?",
    "6:17": "But thanks [be] to God that you were slaves of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart the pattern of teaching to which you were entrusted,",
    "6:18": "and having been set free from sin, you became enslaved to righteousness.",
    "6:19": "(I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh.) For just as you presented your members [as] slaves to immorality and lawlessness, [leading] to lawlessness, so now present your members [as] slaves to righteousness, [leading] to sanctification.",
    "6:20": "For when you were slaves of sin, you were free with respect to righteousness.",
    "6:21": "Therefore what sort of fruit did you have then, about which you are now ashamed? For the end of those [things] [is] death.",
    "6:22": "But now, having been set free from sin and having been enslaved to God, you have your fruit [leading] to sanctification, and its end [is] eternal life.",
    "6:23": "For the compensation due sin [is] death, but the gift of God [is] eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.",
    "7:1": "Or do you not know, brothers (for I am speaking to those who know the law), that the law is master of a person for as long a time [as] he lives?",
    "7:2": "For the married woman is bound by law to [her] husband while he lives, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of the husband.",
    "7:3": "Therefore as a result, if she belongs to another man [while]<note: *Here \"[while]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"is living\") which is understood as temporal> her husband is living, she will be called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress [if she]<note: *Here \"[if]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"belongs\") which is understood as conditional> belongs to another man.",
    "7:4": "So then, my brothers, you also were brought to death with respect to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to the one who was raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God.",
    "7:5": "For when we were in the flesh, sinful desires were working through the law in our members, to bear fruit for death.",
    "7:6": "But now we have been released from the law, [because we]<note: *Here \"[because]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"have died\") which is understood as causal> have died [to that] by which we were bound, so that we may serve in newness of the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter [of the law].",
    "7:7": "What then shall we say? [Is] the law sin? May it never be! But I would not have known sin except through the law, for I would not have known covetousness if the law had not said, \"Do not covet.\"<note: A quotation from Exod 20:17; Deut 5:21>",
    "7:8": "But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all [kinds of] covetousness. For apart from the law, sin [is] dead.",
    "7:9": "And I was alive once, apart from the law, but [when]<note: *Here \"[when]\" is supplied as a component of the participle (\"came\") which is understood as temporal> the commandment came, sin sprang to life",
    "7:10": "and I died, and this commandment which [was] to [lead to] life was found with respect to me to [lead to] death.",
